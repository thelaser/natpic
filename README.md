Hello everyone!

This is a simple script in Perl, which downloads from National's Geographic website the picture of the day.

If no parameter is given, saves the pics it downloads in ~/Pictures/NG, and if a specific folder is supplied, it saves it there.

Beware, since the script works with the raw html from NG's website, if any change is performed to 
the actual image link, the script will probably stop working.
